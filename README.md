# English ⇔ Darija Translator Project

## “Advanced and Accurate English-Moroccan Darija Translation”

`ReactJS`
`Python`
`TypeScript`
`Flask`
`TailwindCSS`
`Shadcn/ui`

## Overview

This project is my final portfolio submission for the **ALX** Software Engineering program (**Holberton School**). It represents the culmination of my learning journey and showcases the skills I've developed throughout the course.

The English ⇔ Darija Translator is more than just a technical demonstration – it's a tool designed to bridge communication gaps and support cultural exchange. As a Moroccan software engineer, I've poured my heart and expertise into creating a resource that will be truly useful for both visitors to Morocco and those interested in learning our unique dialect.

This project combines my passion for technology with a desire to contribute meaningfully to the community. It represents not just what I've learned, but also my vision for how software can solve real-world problems and bring people together.

## The Problem

The project aims to address the lack of online services that provide translation assistance for English speakers learning Moroccan Darija. This problem is particularly relevant in Morocco, where there are many foreigners, including tourists, who may struggle with communication due to language barriers.
